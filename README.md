# aueb-cs-coding
I made this directory as an archive of a few interesting projects as a student at AUEB. This repository isn't exhaustive (it doesn't contain every single coding project especially from the junior year) and will contain mostly computer science projects.
I advise younger students to not use this directory as their homework and i am not responsible if your project is accused for plagiarism as i have commited this projects while i was attending each class.
